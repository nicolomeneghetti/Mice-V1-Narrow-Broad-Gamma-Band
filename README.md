# Mice-V1-Narrow-Broad-Gamma-Band
This repository contains the code for running the computational model described in "Narrow and broad gamma bands process complementary visual information in mouse primary visual cortex"   https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0106-21.2021


The simulations require the Brian2 simulator (https://github.com/brian-team/brian2) and Python3 (https://www.python.org/). 


The main code is in MiceV1_BBandNB_model_code.py.
