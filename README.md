# Mice-V1-Narrow-Broad-Gamma-Band
This repository contains the code for running the computational model described in NicolÃ² Meneghetti, Chiara Cerri, Elena Tantillo, Eleonora Vannini, Matteo Caleo and Alberto Mazzoni "Narrow and broad gamma bands process complementary visual information in mouse primary visual cortex" eNeuro (2021)  https://doi.org/10.1523/ENEURO.0106-21.2021


The simulations require the Brian2 simulator (https://github.com/brian-team/brian2) and Python3 (https://www.python.org/). 


The main code are 

1) MiceV1_BBandNB_model_code.py. 

This code is divided into two parts: 

-) modulation of sustained thalamic input (which is the mean level of firing rates of thalamic afferent to V1). This simulates the spectral LFPs of mice V1 when presented with vertical gratings visual stimuli of contrast level >30. 

-) modulation of rythmic thalamic input (which reflects the oscillatory firing rate of LGN neurons when mice are presented with low contasts visual stimuli). This simulates the spectral LFPs of mice V1 when presented with vertical gratings visual stimuli of contrast level <30.
