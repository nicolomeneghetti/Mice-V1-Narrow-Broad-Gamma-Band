# Mice-V1-Narrow-Broad-Gamma-Band
This repository contains the code for running the computational model described in "Narrow and broad gamma bands process complementary visual information in mouse primary visual cortex"


The simulations require the Brian2 simulator (https://github.com/brian-team/brian2)
